# Martian Robots

## Description

The surface of Mars can be modelled by a rectangular grid around which robots are able to
move according to instructions provided from Earth. This program determines each sequence of robot positions 
and reports the final position of the robot.

A robot position consists of a grid coordinate (a pair of integers: x-coordinate followed by
y-coordinate) and an orientation (N, S, E, W for north, south, east, and west).
A robot instruction is a string of the letters “L”, “R”, and “F” which represent, respectively, the
instructions:
* Left : the robot turns left 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
* Right : the robot turns right 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
* Forward : the robot moves forward one grid point in the direction of the current
orientation and maintains the same orientation.
